# Cursor Context Scout

Use this skill before making code changes when the task would benefit from Cursor's codebase indexing and semantic search. The goal is to spend a small Cursor SDK run to produce a compact file map, then have the current agent read only the relevant files.

## Workflow

1. Do not edit files yet.
2. Locate the bundled script. Use the first existing path:

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` when `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` is available.
- `.agents/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for Codex or other agents using the shared skills path.
- `.claude/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for Claude Code project installs.
- `~/.agents/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for global Agent Skills installs.
- `~/.config/agents/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for global universal Agent Skills installs.
- `~/.cursor/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for global Cursor installs.
- `~/.codex/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for global Codex installs.
- `~/.claude/skills/cursor-context-scout/scripts/cursor-scout.mjs` for global Claude Code installs.

3. Run the scout script from the target repository root:

```bash
node <path-to-cursor-scout.mjs> scout --repo . --task "$ARGUMENTS"
```

4. Read the generated `.cursor-scout/last-scout.json`.
5. Read only the top `recommended_files` first. Expand to `supporting_files` only if implementation needs more context.
6. Then implement the user's requested change using the current agent's normal editing tools.
7. Do not commit `.cursor-scout/` unless the user explicitly wants scout artifacts checked in.

## First Run

The first scout run may be slower because Cursor may need to prepare or warm its codebase index. The script will bootstrap `@cursor/sdk` into a user cache directory if the package is not already available.

Requirements:

- A Cursor API key must be configured with `configure` or set as `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
- Node.js 22+ is recommended by Cursor's SDK examples.
- Network access is needed the first time `@cursor/sdk` is installed into the cache.

Configure the Cursor API key if `doctor` reports that no key is available. Use global setup for all repositories:

```bash
node <path-to-cursor-scout.mjs> configure --scope global
```

Global setup writes an `export CURSOR_API_KEY=...` block to the user's shell profile such as `~/.zshrc`. Use project setup to write `.env.local` in the target repo:

```bash
node <path-to-cursor-scout.mjs> configure --scope project --repo .
```

`CURSOR_API_KEY` in the current process has highest priority. Project `.env.local` is read next, then the global shell profile.

Run a setup check:

```bash
node <path-to-cursor-scout.mjs> doctor --install-sdk
```

Run a warmup without a concrete task:

```bash
node <path-to-cursor-scout.mjs> warmup --repo .
```

## Guardrails

- Treat Cursor as a read-only scout. The prompt explicitly forbids edits, dependency installs, commits, and destructive commands.
- Cursor has not documented a direct public API for reading its embedding index. This skill asks Cursor Agent to use its codebase tools and return a compact file map.
- If the scout JSON cannot be parsed, inspect `.cursor-scout/last-scout.raw.txt` and decide manually.
- If the user explicitly asks you to skip scouting or the repo is small enough that direct inspection is cheaper, proceed without this skill.
- Do not paste secrets into prompts. Use environment variables.

## Output

The script writes:

- `.cursor-scout/last-scout.json`: parsed scout result.
- `.cursor-scout/last-scout.raw.txt`: raw Cursor response for debugging.
